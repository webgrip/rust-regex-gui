# Development

This project uses a simple Makefile to streamline common tasks. Useful targets include:

- `make run` – run the application.
- `make fmt` – format the code base using `cargo fmt`.
- `make clippy` – run `cargo clippy` with warnings as errors.
- `make test` – execute unit tests.
- `make docs` – serve the documentation locally via MkDocs.

The source code adheres to conventional commits and is organized with hexagonal architecture principles.
